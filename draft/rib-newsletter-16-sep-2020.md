## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

[Conflux Network](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain).

Conflux Network is a PoW blockchain written in Rust that achieves 3000+ transactions per second through the innovative [Tree-Graph structure](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc20-li-chenxing.pdf), and is only state-endorsed public, permissionless blockchain project in China. The goal of Conflux Network is to provide a stable yet highly scalable foundation for developers to build and grow new applications and marketplaces in Web3 through our many benefits such as:
* EVM compatibility
* High transaction rates and low transaction fees
* [Native staking](https://medium.com/conflux-network/conflux-economic-model-staking-collateral-for-storage-on-conflux-network-cb4c8c150e3)
* [Transaction sponsorship mechanism](https://medium.com/conflux-network/conflux-transaction-sponsorship-mechanism-2c9acfe770c2)
* [Grants program](https://www.grants.confluxnetwork.org/)
* Chinese community access
